<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The AC Torque Motors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>1-Phase</li><li>3-Phase</li></ul></p>
<p><p>AC Torque Motors come in two main types: 1-Phase and 3-Phase motors. 1-Phase motors are typically used in smaller applications where only a single phase of power is available. They are simple and cost-effective, but may lack the power output of 3-Phase motors. On the other hand, 3-Phase motors are more common in industrial settings due to their higher power output and efficiency. They are able to handle heavier loads and provide smoother operation compared to 1-Phase motors.</p></p>
