<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Multifunctional High Frequency Knifes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monopolar Circuit</li><li>Bipolar Circuit</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Multifunctional High Frequency Knifes come in two main types: Monopolar Circuit and Bipolar Circuit. The Monopolar Circuit type utilizes a single electrode for cutting or coagulation, while the current returns through a grounding pad placed on the patient's body. On the other hand, the Bipolar Circuit type uses two electrodes which are both contained within the instrument, allowing for more precise cutting and coagulation without the need for a grounding pad. Both types offer different benefits depending on the specific surgical procedure being performed.</p></p>
