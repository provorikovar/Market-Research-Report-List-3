<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Esophageal Dilation Balloon Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air Balloon</li><li>Water Balloon</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Esophageal dilation balloons are used to widen narrowed sections of the esophagus. There are two main types of esophageal dilation balloons: air balloons and water balloons. Air balloons are typically made of a silicone material and are inflated with air to dilate the esophagus. Water balloons, on the other hand, are filled with a sterile saline solution to achieve dilation. Both types of balloons are effective in treating conditions like strictures and dysphagia, with the choice between them depending on the specific needs of the patient.</p></p>
