<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Vehicle Tire Molds Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Segmented Molds</li><li>Two-Piece Molds</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Segmented molds are used for manufacturing commercial vehicle tires in which the mold is divided into multiple segments that can be adjusted individually to achieve various tread patterns and designs. This allows for more flexibility and customization in tire production. Two-piece molds, on the other hand, consist of two separate parts that come together to form the tire shape. This type of mold is simpler in design but still provides the necessary flexibility for producing different tire sizes and styles.</p></p>
