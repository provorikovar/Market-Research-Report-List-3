<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Plastic Sorting Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Chute-Type Sorting Machine</li><li>Belt-Type Sorting Machine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Plastic sorting machines are categorized into two main types: Chute-Type Sorting Machine and Belt-Type Sorting Machine. Chute-Type Sorting Machines use gravity to separate different types of plastics by dropping them down separate chutes based on their characteristics. On the other hand, Belt-Type Sorting Machines use a conveyor belt system to move plastics to different sorting stations where they are separated based on sensors and predetermined criteria. Both types of machines are essential in the recycling industry for efficiently sorting and segregating plastics for further processing.</p></p>
