<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electromagnetic Suspension Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pure Active Suspension</li><li>Semi-Active Suspension</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electromagnetic suspension systems can be categorized into two main types: pure active suspension and semi-active suspension. Pure active suspension systems use electromagnetic actuators to actively control and adjust the suspension in real-time, providing the highest level of control and performance. On the other hand, semi-active suspension systems utilize electromagnetic dampers to adjust the suspension based on vehicle dynamics and road conditions, offering a balance between performance and cost-effectiveness. Both types of electromagnetic suspension systems provide improved stability, comfort, and control compared to traditional suspension systems.</p></p>
