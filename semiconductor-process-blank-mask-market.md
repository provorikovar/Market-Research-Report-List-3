<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Semiconductor Process Blank Mask Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low Reflectivity Chrome Blank Mask</li><li>Halftone Phase Shift Blank Mask</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Semiconductor process blank masks are essential in the production of semiconductors. Two types of blank masks commonly used are low reflectivity chrome blank masks and halftone phase shift blank masks. Low reflectivity chrome blank masks reduce reflection during the photolithography process, improving overall accuracy. Halftone phase shift blank masks use varying transmission levels to create phase shifts in the light passing through, enhancing resolution and reducing distortion. Both types play a crucial role in semiconductor manufacturing by aiding in precise patterning and etching processes.</p></p>
