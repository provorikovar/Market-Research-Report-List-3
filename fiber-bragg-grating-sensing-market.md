<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fiber Bragg Grating Sensing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Distributed Sensing</li><li>Fiber Optic Point Sensing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensing technology is utilized in two main market types: Distributed Sensing and Fiber Optic Point Sensing. Distributed Sensing involves the use of FBG arrays along the length of a fiber optic cable to provide continuous monitoring of structural health or environmental conditions. Fiber Optic Point Sensing, on the other hand, uses individual FBG sensors at specific points along the cable for localized measurements. Both types offer high precision and reliability in applications such as structural monitoring, oil and gas pipeline monitoring, and temperature sensing in harsh environments.</p></p>
