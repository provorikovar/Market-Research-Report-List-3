<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Transport Aircraft Simulation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Full Flight Simulation</li><li>Partial Flight Simulation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Full Flight Simulation in the transport aircraft simulation market refers to simulators that replicate the entire flight experience, from takeoff to landing, including realistic cockpit controls and visuals. These simulators provide a highly immersive training environment for pilots. Partial Flight Simulation, on the other hand, only replicates certain aspects of flight, such as specific maneuvers or emergency procedures. While not as realistic as full flight simulators, partial simulators are more cost-effective and can still effectively train pilots on crucial skills.</p></p>
