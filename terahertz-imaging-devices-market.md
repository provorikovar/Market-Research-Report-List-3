<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Terahertz Imaging Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Terahertz Imaging</li><li>Active Terahertz Imaging</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Terahertz imaging devices can be classified into two main types: passive and active imaging. Passive terahertz imaging devices detect natural terahertz radiation emitted by objects, allowing for non-invasive imaging. On the other hand, active terahertz imaging devices emit terahertz radiation themselves and analyze the reflections to create an image. Both types have their own advantages and applications, with passive imaging being more suitable for security screening and active imaging being more useful for material characterization and medical imaging.</p></p>
