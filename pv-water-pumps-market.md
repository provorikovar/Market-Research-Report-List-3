<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PV Water Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Surface Suction</li><li>Submersible</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PV water pumps are categorized into two main types: surface suction pumps and submersible pumps. Surface suction pumps are installed above the water source and use suction to draw water up. They are suitable for shallow water sources. Submersible pumps, on the other hand, are installed underwater and push water to the surface. They are ideal for deep water sources. Both types of pumps are powered by solar energy, making them environmentally friendly and cost-effective solutions for water pumping needs.</p></p>
