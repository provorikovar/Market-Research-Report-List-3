<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Current Regulator Diodes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>SMD</li><li>Through Hole</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Current regulator diodes are available in two main types: Surface Mount Device (SMD) and Through Hole. SMD diodes are smaller in size and are mounted directly onto the surface of a circuit board, allowing for more efficient use of space. Through Hole diodes have leads that are inserted through holes in the circuit board and soldered in place. They are generally larger in size compared to SMD diodes, but are known for their durability and strong mechanical connection. Both types cater to different application requirements and preferences within the electronics industry.</p></p>
