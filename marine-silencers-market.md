<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Marine Silencers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Resistive</li><li>Reactive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Marine silencers can be classified into two main types: resistive and reactive. Resistive silencers use sound-absorbing materials to reduce noise levels by dissipating the sound energy. On the other hand, reactive silencers utilize acoustic principles to cancel out specific noise frequencies. Resistive silencers are effective in reducing overall noise levels, while reactive silencers are better suited for targeting and eliminating specific noise frequencies. Both types of silencers play a crucial role in improving the acoustic comfort and safety of marine environments.</p></p>
