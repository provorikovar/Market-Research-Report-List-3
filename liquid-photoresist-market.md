<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Liquid Photoresist Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Photoresist</li><li>Negative Photoresist</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Liquid photoresist is a crucial component in the semiconductor manufacturing process, with two main types: positive photoresist and negative photoresist. Positive photoresist becomes more soluble when exposed to light, allowing for the removal of the unexposed portions during development. In contrast, negative photoresist becomes less soluble when exposed to light, enabling the retention of the unexposed areas. Both types play a vital role in creating intricate patterns on semiconductor wafers, ultimately determining the functionality of the final integrated circuits.</p></p>
