<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The NBR Foam Products Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed Cell Rubber</li><li>Semi-closed Cell Rubber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>NBR foam products are available in two main market types: closed cell rubber and semi-closed cell rubber. Closed cell rubber has sealed cells that do not allow water or air to pass through, making it ideal for applications requiring high resistance to water absorption and insulation properties. Semi-closed cell rubber has partially sealed cells that allow limited air and water penetration, providing a balance between insulation and flexibility. Both types of NBR foam products offer excellent durability, shock absorption, and thermal insulation properties.</p></p>
