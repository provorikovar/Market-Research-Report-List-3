<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photo Resist Photosensitive Polymer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Negative Types</li><li>Positive Types</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Photoresist photosensitive polymers are used in various industries for microfabrication processes. The two main types are negative and positive. Negative types react to light by becoming insoluble in developer solution, creating a pattern where the resist is removed. Positive types, on the other hand, become soluble in the developer solution when exposed to light, allowing for the desired pattern to remain on the substrate. Both types play crucial roles in creating intricate and precise designs in industries such as electronics, semiconductor, and biotechnology.</p></p>
