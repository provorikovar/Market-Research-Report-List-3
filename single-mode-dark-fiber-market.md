<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Single Mode Dark Fiber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Glass</li><li>Plastic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Single Mode Dark Fiber refers to optical fibers that are not currently being used for data transmission. These fibers can be classified into two types: glass and plastic. Glass fibers are made from silica and have a higher bandwidth, making them suitable for long-distance communication. Plastic fibers are made from polymers and are more flexible and cost-effective, making them ideal for short-distance applications. Both types of dark fiber have their own advantages and are used in different scenarios based on their properties.</p></p>
