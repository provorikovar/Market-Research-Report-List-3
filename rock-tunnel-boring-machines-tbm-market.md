<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rock Tunnel Boring Machines （TBM） Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open-type TBM</li><li>Shielded Hard Rock TBM</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rock Tunnel Boring Machines (TBM) are used for excavating tunnels in hard rock. There are two main types of TBMs - Open-type TBM and Shielded Hard Rock TBM. Open-type TBMs are suitable for softer rock formations and operate without a shield. Shielded Hard Rock TBMs, on the other hand, are designed to handle extremely hard rock conditions and feature a shield to protect the machine and operators. Both types of TBMs are essential for tunnel construction projects in various geological settings.</p></p>
