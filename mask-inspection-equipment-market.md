<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mask Inspection Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Die to Die (DD) Method</li><li>Die to Database (DB) Method</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Mask inspection equipment is classified into two main types: Die to Die (DD) Method and Die to Database (DB) Method. The DD Method compares two identical dies on a mask, while the DB Method compares the actual die on the mask to a database of intended die shapes. The DD Method is useful for detecting defects between identical dies, while the DB Method is effective for identifying discrepancies between the mask and the intended design. Both methods play a crucial role in ensuring the quality and accuracy of semiconductor manufacturing processes.</p></p>
