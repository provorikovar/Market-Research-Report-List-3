<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Deep Cycle Batteries Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>VRLA</li><li>FLA</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Deep cycle batteries are divided into two main types in the market: Valve Regulated Lead Acid (VRLA) and Flooded Lead Acid (FLA). VRLA batteries are sealed and require minimal maintenance, making them ideal for applications where ventilation is limited. FLA batteries, on the other hand, require regular maintenance and adequate ventilation due to the release of gases during charging. Both types are designed for deep discharge and long cycle life, but their specific characteristics make them suitable for different applications.</p></p>
