<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Small Wind Power Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine</li><li>Vertical Axis Wind Turbine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Small wind power market consists of two main types: Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines (HAWTs) and Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWTs). HAWTs are the most common type, with blades rotating on a horizontal axis to capture wind energy efficiently. VAWTs have blades that rotate on a vertical axis, making them suitable for urban or crowded areas where wind direction can fluctuate. Both types offer sustainable energy solutions for residential, commercial, and remote locations.</p></p>
